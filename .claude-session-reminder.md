# Session Reminder - December 21, 2025

## ⚠️ PRIORITY ISSUE TO ADDRESS

### Resources Page - Additional Information Box Issue
**Location:** `/app/resources/page.tsx` - "Additional Information" section (lines ~166-195)

**What to check:** The user noticed an issue with the "Additional Information" box on the resources page but didn't specify the exact problem.

**Action needed at start of next session:**
1. Ask user to describe the specific issue with the Additional Information section
2. Review the section for potential problems:
   - Layout/styling issues
   - Content issues
   - Link functionality (currently all links are "#" placeholders)
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Visual appearance
